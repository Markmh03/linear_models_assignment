        "A transplant selection model must address bias and fairness, since the training data are not randomized and may reflect differences in access or care we should test performance and calibration across subgroups and correct any disparate impact. The target label and predictors must avoid proxies for sensitive traits and be clinically relevant. The model should be interpretable to clinicians with clear feature contributions and documentation of limits. Before deployment we need external validation and we must set decision thresholds that align with ethical medical policy rather than pure accuracy. In use the tool should support clinician judgment, with an appeals path for contested decisions. We must monitor calibration, performance, and data drift over time under formal supervision with versioning and audits. Finally, data privacy and security must meet HIPAA standards (as this is federal law), with strong encryption and restriction on use from others."
